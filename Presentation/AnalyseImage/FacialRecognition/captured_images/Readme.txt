All images captured in face and eye detection will be inside this folder.
If you delete this folder then no captured images will be stored.
If you rename this folder make sure the file name is the same as the DetectionFaces.py file where the original line is this: save_path = root_directory + '\\captured_images\\'+ file_path;
